They have to decide what to do in an ever-changing city and be sure that the city and its people have everything they need to live. There are lots of problems and difficult things for the players to do but this makes the player think carefully so that they can make the best decision. This will probably help them in the real world. Players must be over eighteen years old to play this game.\nFast Drive \nFast Drive is a game that has lots of dangerous driving in it. Players are rewarded for driving on the wrong side of the road, driving into other cars or motorbikes, and creating problems all over a city. Parents of new teenage drivers might want to think about the fact that playing some racing games can make their children want to drive in such a way in real life. This game also has an online part that allows for chat, so each player will hear everything that other online players say. \nDinosaurs\nWhat kid hasn't thought about how much fun it would be to have a pet dinosaur as a best friend, or maybe to go for a ride on the back of a fire-eating animal? Dinosaurs is perfect for children aged between 10 and 14. The players work with dinosaurs that they have found. The game is all about becoming friends with your dinosaur and it is like going on an adventure with a loved family pet that has big teeth.

I did the walk with a special group because it can be quite dangerous especially if the weather is bad. They have a guide who shows you where to walk.

I was very afraid. No one was hurt but we did get very wet. The most important thing about this challenge is the clothes you wear. That means you need good walking boots, trousers and jacket, and a hat for the sun. It doesn't matter what your clothes look like but they mustbe comfortable. Also, you need a small bag.\nI had a brilliant time on the challenge even though it rained.
